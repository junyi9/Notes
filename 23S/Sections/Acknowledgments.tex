The acknowledgements page is optional. Acknowledgement of grant and contract support may be included on this page. This is also where you thank the people that made your work possible: advisers, your committee, mom, friends, etc. For example, Vanderbilt University would like to thank Eli Hootener for creating the original  \LaTeX{}  template for dissertations and Haley Adams for reorganizing and updating the document.
